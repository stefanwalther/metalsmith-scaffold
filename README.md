# metalsmith-scaffold

> A quite comprehensive setup based on Metalsmith to create a static website.

**Work in progress: stay tuned**

## About

The goal of this project is to create a nice scaffold using Metalsmith which can then be used in multiple projects with very little configuration.

### Status so far

What's planned (not everything covered right now):

* **Different:**

  - layouts
  - content types
  - collections

* **Dynamic loading** of:
  - handlebar templates
  - partials
  - Metalsmith plugins

* Site **features**:
  - Tags
* Full test coverage to ensure that everything continues to work

## Configuration

Configuring the scaffold is very similar to using metalsmith-cli, but the big difference is still, that no CLI is use, but everything is nicely available in a JavaScript API, therefore much easier to ensure desired output in some test.
The following options needs to be defined to get the project up and running:

### Source

```json
source: "path/to/source"
```

### Destination

```json
destination: "path/to/destination"
```

# metalsmith-scaffold

> A quite comprehensive setup based on Metalsmith to create a static website.

**Work in progress: stay tuned**

## About

The goal of this project is to create a nice scaffold using Metalsmith which can then be used in multiple projects with very little configuration.

### Status so far

What's planned (not everything covered right now):

* **Different:**

  - layouts
  - content types
  - collections

* **Dynamic loading** of:
  - handlebar templates
  - partials
  - Metalsmith plugins

* Site **features**:
  - Tags
* Full test coverage to ensure that everything continues to work

## Configuration

Configuring the scaffold is very similar to using [metalsmith-cli](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#cli), but the big difference is still, that no CLI is used, everything is nicely available in a JavaScript API.
Therefore much easier to deploy programmatically and output can be automatically tested.

### Configuration Options

The following options needs to be defined to get the project up and running:

#### Source

```json
source: "path/to/source"
```

Reference: [https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#sourcepath](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#sourcepath)

#### Destination

```json
destination: "path/to/destination"
```

Reference: [https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#destinationpath](https://github.com/segmentio/metalsmith#destinationpath)

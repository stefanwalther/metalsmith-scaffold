The goal of this project is to create a nice scaffold using Metalsmith which can then be used in multiple projects with very little configuration.

### Status so far
What's planned (not everything covered right now):

- **Different:**
	- layouts
	- content types
	- collections
- **Dynamic loading** of:
	- handlebar templates
	- partials
	- Metalsmith plugins
- Site **features**:
	- Tags
- Full test coverage to ensure that everything continues to work

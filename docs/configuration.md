Configuring the scaffold is very similar to using metalsmith-cli, but the big difference is still, that no CLI is use, but everything is nicely available in a JavaScript API, therefore much easier to ensure desired output in some test.
The following options needs to be defined to get the project up and running:

### Source

```json
source: "path/to/source"
```

### Destination

```json
destination: "path/to/destination"
```
